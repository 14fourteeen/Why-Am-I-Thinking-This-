# Why Am I Thinking This?

Minimal single-page React app to capture a thought and walk through guided prompts.

Quick start:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:5173

Features:
- Capture a thought and optional guided prompt responses
- Entries saved to localStorage
- Export entries to JSON
- Simple UI ready for enhancements (sync, auth, analytics)

Next steps you might want:
- Add a backend (API + DB) to persist entries cross-device
- Add authentication (email/password or OAuth)
- Add tagging, filtering, search, or analytics
- Make a PWA for offline use
